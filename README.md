# brAIkdown

brAIkdown seeks to generate novel breakdowns, given a training set of existing breakdowns. It will train on and generate only notation. Turning this notation to sound will still require human musicians, or software.

## Data Reprentation

Data is represented as arrays, with each row corresponding to a musical timestep, usually a 16th note, and each column corresponding to an instrument. Currently, there is only enough data to meaninfully learn patterns of the kick drum and lowest 2 guitar strings, with the cymbals and snares accepted to be every 4 and every 12th of 16 16th notes respectively.

## Midi Demos

Some midi demos have been transcribed using sequences generated by the model. Some creative freedom has been taken with the cymbals and snare. A function to automatically transcribe the array output of the model to midi is in development.
